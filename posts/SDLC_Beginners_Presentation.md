# Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
## A Beginner's Guide

## What is SDLC?
- SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle
- A process to design, develop, test & maintain software
- Ensures high-quality, cost-effective delivery

## Why is SDLC Important?
- Provides structure
- Helps manage complex projects
- Ensures documentation and tracking
- Improves project success rate

## SDLC Phases Overview
1. Requirement Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

## Phase 1 – Requirement Gathering
- Understand client/user needs
- Stakeholders: clients, analysts, managers
- Output: Requirement Specification Document

## Phase 2 – Planning
- Estimate cost, resources, timeline
- Perform risk analysis
- Output: Project plan, schedule, feasibility study

## Phase 3 – Design
- Create architecture, UI/UX
- Choose technologies/tools
- Output: Design Documents, wireframes, prototypes

## Phase 4 – Development
- Actual coding begins
- Follow design and standards
- Use version control

## Phase 5 – Testing
- Identify bugs/issues
- Types: Unit, Integration, System, UAT
- Output: Test reports, verified product

## Phase 6 – Deployment
- Deliver software to customer
- Manual or automated (CI/CD)
- Monitor performance

## Phase 7 – Maintenance
- Bug fixes and updates
- Ongoing support and improvements

## SDLC Models
- Waterfall Model
- Agile Model
- Spiral Model
- V-Model
- Incremental/Iterative Model

## Summary
- SDLC ensures organized development
- Phases manage projects better
- Choose model per project needs
